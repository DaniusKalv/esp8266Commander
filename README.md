# esp8266 Commander

This is a windows application for testing and setting up an ESP8266 module using AT commands. An arduino, ftdi or other prefered module can be used as a USB to UART bridge. The commands are split into two sections: basic and advanced. Basic commands are executed instantly on a click of a button. Advanced commands are executed when an execute button is clicked. When an advanced command is selected, some extra information about it is displayed underneath. All the information about the ESP8266 commands is taken from <a href="https://room-15.github.io/blog/2015/03/26/esp8266-at-command-reference/">this page</a> (credits to the author).
